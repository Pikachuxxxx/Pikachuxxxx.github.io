# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Pikachuxxx or my friends call me Phani (and so can you). I'm a Graphics Programmer at Sony.

what more do you want?.. I love pixels.....ummmm crunchhhyyy mnom mnom mnom tasty...pixelsssss.

I love designing and playing with custom engines and experiment with all the graphics APIs. My area of interest is to learn and improve the existing rendering techiniques. I also make homebrew apps for PSVita and PS3.

//TODO: To be updated more about me after I finish eating these tasty pixels.
