Well Welcome! If you're here it means you are in for some nostalgic adventure. The PlayStationâ„¢3 system is one of the most hardest and intriguing hardware ever built. It's unique cell architecture makes things challenging, which also makes the entire process of learning even more exciting. In the coming blog posts we'll dive deeper into the Architecture and detailed tutorial series on how to develop and take full advantage of the SDK and use other industry popular frameworks. In order to take full advantage of the PS3 system it is importatnt to know in detail about it's hardware architecture and understand what makes it special.

Before we get all technical let us first setup out environment and explore some samples, samples are a great way to stay motivated and explore the SDK. We'll see what all tools we will be needing along with the SDK and configure everything to start our journey deep down the rabbit hole. I will also explain the structure of the SDK in detail in the coming posts.

Good news! You don't actuall need an actual PS3 Development kit that actually looks like this :


But there's a catch and If you're lucky enough and gave either a PS3 Phat or one of the PS3 Slim(CECH-200xx, 250x) you can jail break them! Yes you'll need a jailbroken console running on a specific custom firmware (Rebug DEX) to actually develop. Strictly speaking it's not entirely legal maybe! We will be using a lot of Leaked and deprecated stuff, but that's the fun right!

#### CEX vs DEX


### Jailbreaking your console
There are many amazing youtube videos explaining this so I'm going to link to some of them here. You can continue reading this after you have jailbroken your console.

**! Remember to use the Rebug Custom firmware, because we will be using the DEX(developer firmware) version of the

If you need to downgrade your system no worries! Here is a video on it (It will probably be necessary if you're on 4.88 because Rebug-DEX is only available upto 4.84)

### Converting from CEX to DEX
 I would suggest you to follow this amazing youtube tutorial, that makes this look very easy.

 Congratulations! Now you have an unofficial PS3 Development Kit! Hooray!! (probably illegal too idk)

 Don't the worry the feds don't care.

### Setting up your development Environment
Now you can move to your PC and get ready be a software pirate.
