Hieee all, Phani here. I‚Äôm in the HimalayasüèîÔ∏è for the NYE‚Äô25, a fun adventure for this ‚Äùtechbro‚Äù to **push myself out
of the comfort zone** and start off the next journey. Ik nothing will change in a day but NYE gives you a reason
to start something, take a break and reflect and pursue further, at the end of the day it‚Äôs you who gotta bring the change.
Recover from the burnout and get back at it soon! But I‚Äôm loving it here, the cold and the serene life in the
hills is making me realize the capitalistic gains we chase over all the time instead of knowledge. I also went to this
amazing and soothing cafe ‚ÄùAaarcana‚Äù in Tapovan, Rishkesh. Will write more about this trip once I‚Äôm back in my next post. 
A lot of ‚ÄùWe‚Äôre cooked!‚Äù moments have been happening lol. Let‚Äôs get into it for now shall we?

## Introduction

---

As a long standing Vulkan developer myself exploring DirectX12 to port my [Razix Engine](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/Razix), 
understanding D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC can feel analogous to Vulkan‚Äôs `VkPipelineLayout` and `VkDescriptorSetLayout.`Both define how resources such as
constant buffers, textures, and samplers are bound to shaders and how to manage descriptor Heaps via Tables/Sets.

In this article I will try explain and understand the usage of D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC from a Vulkan devel-
oper‚Äôs perspective, focusing on key similarities and differences, while walking through questions I ask myself while
transitioning between the APIs.

## D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC - The Basics

---

The `D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC` structure describes the root signature layout in DirectX12, it contains all the
range of resources that will be bound per shader such as descriptor table (contains descriptors info per register
space), static samplers and root constants, inline descriptors (any of the CBV, SRV or UAVs). This is the structure
that defines it:

```cpp
struct D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC {
    UINT NumParameters;
    const D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER* pParameters;
    UINT NumStaticSamplers;
    const D3D12_STATIC_SAMPLER_DESC* pStaticSamplers;
    D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAGS Flags;
};
```

- **NumParameters and pParameters:** Define the number and details of root parameters, which include descriptor
tables, 32-bit root constants, and inline descriptors
- **NumStaticSamplers and pStaticSamplers:** Specify static samplers that are immutable during the lifetime
of the root signature
- **Flags:** Provide additional configuration options, such as enabling or disabling specific shader stages for
visibility of root signature and resources

## D3D12 vs Vulkan

---

### Is D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC a Vulkan VkPipelineLayout in disguise?

Yes, `D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC` is similar to Vulkan‚Äôs VkPipelineLayout. Both describe how resources are
bound to shaders and how the GPU accesses them via tables. The key difference lies in how resources are setup in
the heaps and accessed, with D3D12 offering root parameters and heap types like **CBV/SRV/UAV** and more memory control focued where as Vulkan relying
heavily on descriptor sets and pipeline layouts with set types allowing mix and match in a granular layout focused setup.

### What About Descriptor Heaps and Tables?

Descriptor tables in DirectX 12 are conceptually similar to Vulkan‚Äôs descriptor sets. They group resources like constant buffers (CBVs), 
shader resource views (SRVs), and unordered access views (UAVs are basically read/write
enabled resources). You use D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE
to define them. Descriptor Heaps in DirectX 12 provide a contiguous memory region where descriptors are stored
and can be accessed directly by shaders.

DirectX 12 defines these Descriptor Heaps, each suited for specific resource types:
- **CBV/SRV/UAV Heap:** Used for Constant Buffer Views (CBV), Shader Resource Views (SRV), and
Unordered Access Views (UAV).
- **Sampler Heap:** Dedicated to sampler descriptors.
- **RTV/DSV Heap:** Used for Render Target Views (RTV) and Depth Stencil Views (DSV). These heaps are
not shader-visible and are primarily managed on the CPU for creating depth and swapchain image targets.

Vulkan‚Äôs `VkDescriptorPool`, on the other hand, acts as a more granular allocation system for `VkDescriptorSet`
objects, which group descriptors and are bound to shaders at the set level. Vulkan takes a layout-focused approach,
organizing descriptors into `VkDescriptorSet` objects with clearly defined layouts tied to the pipeline. **DirectX 12,
on the other hand, is more memory-focused, using Descriptor Heaps as a contiguous storage structures for shaders to access.**

### Are Root Constants equivalent to Vulkan Push Constants?
Yes in a way, you can define root constants in D3D12 using the param type `D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_32BIT_CONSTANTS`
while passing to pParameters and they are equivalent to Vulkan‚Äôs push constants. Both allow small amounts of
frequently updated data (like transformation matrices or bindless resource indices etc.) to be passed directly to
shaders without using a buffer. For example, in Vulkan, you might define push constants for per-draw updates, and
in D3D12, you‚Äôd use root constants for the same purpose. They are 32-bit DWORDS and are usually maxed out at
128/256-bytes or so, check with your GPU vendor for the device limits.

_Note:- while using shader reflecting unlike Vulkan, DirectX12 can‚Äôt know if they are root constants, it‚Äôs defined as a cbuffer
in HLSL. So use a constant name like struct PushConstant while reflecting to check if the shader is using a root
constant. if so, pass that data via the root signature._

### What are Inline Descriptors, and are they like Vulkan Push Descriptors?
Inline descriptors `D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_CBV/SRV/UAV` can be be directly bound into the root
signature without using descriptor tables. These are similar to Vulkan‚Äôs `VK_KHR_push_descriptor` extension features,
which allows you to bind resources dynamically and directly without pre-allocated descriptor sets. They are
sometimes useful than push constants are they don‚Äôt have restrictions on data size but have much higher overhead
if bound as frequently as a root constant/push constant so thread with caution when using.

## Typical Usage - Push Constants and Descriptor Tables

---

This what you‚Äôll be doing in most scenarios:

- **Descriptor Tables:** Use `D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE` for resource management. This
is analogous to Vulkan‚Äôs descriptor sets, select a heap type (`CBV_UAV_SRV/Sampler/DTV/RTV`) and define the
resource structure for all heaps using descriptors.

- **Root/Push Constants:** Use `D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_32BIT_CONSTANTS` for lightweight and frequent
updates, just like Vulkan push constants. These are ideal for small data that changes per draw or dispatch.
They are defined as cbuffer (I suggest don‚Äôt specify and register binding info and leave it alone) in
HLSL but you can pass/update it‚Äôs data when binding the root signature.

```cpp
// Define a descriptor table with SRVs and CBVs
D3D12_ROOT_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE descriptorTable = {};
descriptorTable.NumDescriptorRanges = 1;
descriptorTable.pDescriptorRanges = &descriptorRange;
// Define root constants
D3D12_ROOT_CONSTANTS rootConstants = {};
rootConstants.ShaderRegister = 0;
rootConstants.RegisterSpace = 0;
rootConstants.Num32BitValues = 4;
// Define root parameters
D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER rootParameters[2] = {};
rootParameters[0].ParameterType = D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE;
rootParameters[0].DescriptorTable = descriptorTable;
rootParameters[0].ShaderVisibility = D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_ALL;
rootParameters[1].ParameterType = D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_32BIT_CONSTANTS;
rootParameters[1].Constants = rootConstants;
rootParameters[1].ShaderVisibility = D3D12_SHADER_VISIBILITY_VERTEX;
// Create the root signature
D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_DESC rootSignatureDesc = {};
rootSignatureDesc.NumParameters = _countof(rootParameters);
rootSignatureDesc.pParameters = rootParameters;
rootSignatureDesc.Flags = D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE_FLAG_ALLOW_INPUT_ASSEMBLER_INPUT_LAYOUT;
```
_example of how a root signature is filled with a descriptor set and root constants_

## Misc stuff I ask myself

---

#### Why Not Use Inline Descriptors All the Time?
Inline descriptors are great for quick and direct resource binding when your data exceeds the size of a root constant,
but they lack flexibility and can quickly cause binding overhead if bound and updated frequently.

#### How Are Static Samplers Used?
Static samplers are immutable samplers defined in the root signature. These are analogous to Vulkan‚Äôs immutable
samplers in descriptor set layouts. For example, if you have a fixed sampler configuration for certain textures, you
can define them here.

#### How Do Flags Work?
The Flags field in D3D12 ROOT SIGNATURE DESC allows you to optimize or restrict certain stages. For example, you
can specify D3D12 ROOT SIGNATURE FLAG DENY PIXEL SHADER ROOT ACCESS to block resource access from the pixel
shader stage, improving performance by helping driver optimize early.

## How it's done in Razix Engine

---

When using HLSL with D3D12, I typically rely on root constants `D3D12_ROOT_PARAMETER_TYPE_32BIT_CONSTANTS`
to emulate Vulkan‚Äôs push constants. This way we can have lightweight and direct access to frequently updated
data. And I use descriptor tables to handle resource binding in the usual way. Almost no inline descriptors at all
and almost never update descriptor sets, atleast not every frame. Here is an example of using push constants in Razix Engine:

```cpp
#ifdef __GLSL__    // GLSL - shading language for Vulkan (SPIRV) & OpenGL.

    #define PUSH_CONSTANT(T)       [[vk::push_constant]] T pcData
    #define GET_PUSH_CONSTANT(mem) pcData.mem

#elif defined __HLSL__    // HLSL - DirectX backend shading language.

    #define PUSH_CONSTANT(T) \
        cbuffer T##Buffer    \
        {                    \
            T pcData;        \
        };
    #define GET_PUSH_CONSTANT(mem) pcData.mem

#endif
```

_example of disguising push constants in Razix Engine_

```cpp

// Push constant structure
struct PushConstantData {
    float4 color;
    float4x4 transform;
};

PUSH_CONSTANT(PushConstantData);

// Descriptor tables for resource binding
Texture2D myTexture : register(t0, space0);
SamplerState mySampler : register(s0, space0);

// Shader code
float4 main(float4 position : POSITION) : SV_POSITION {
    float4 worldPosition = mul(GET_PUSH_CONSTANT(transform), position);
    return worldPosition * GET_PUSH_CONSTANT(color);
}

```

_how to use push constants in Razix Engine_

So while reflection I create descriptor bindings for all resources and when I get the type PushConstant, 
(all shaders use the same named struct) and skip it and let the users bind the resources based on the resource 
view hints given and assign the corresponding heap `CBV_SRV_UAV/Sampler/DTV/RTV`.  


## Closing Notes

By thinking of descriptor tables as descriptor sets for resource management and root constants (or `cbuffer` for emulation) as push constants
for small, frequent updates, Vulkan devs can adapt to D3D12 intuitively. Inline descriptors can be thought of as a more direct but less 
flexible alternative using the vulkan push descriptor extension.  Also, **Descriptor Heap is the memory backing structure for Descriptor 
Table resources.** They are in a sense analogoues to Vulkan's `VkDescriptorPool` to allocate sets from but with more memory level control than vulkan.

That's it for today, until next time. Byee!
